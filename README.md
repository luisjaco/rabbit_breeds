# rabbit_breeds
Welcome to rabbit_breeds! A SQL database of over 100 different rabbit breeds, made by Luis Jaco, using PostgreSQL.

This is a SQL database including 188 different rabbit breeds, with additional information for each rabbit.

This is a project made to showcase my knowledge with SQL.

# Features
* This is a 3NF database of 188 different rabbit breeds with features like indexes, constraints, and parent-child relationships.
* Each rabbit has a description which includes: ear type, color, ARBA (American Rabbit Breeders Association) recognition, BRC (British Rabbit Council) recognition, size range (in kilograms), fur type(s), and origin(s).
* In this repository, there are SQL files for both viewing and inserting rabbit data.

# Notes
* By all means, this is not intended to be a professional source of rabbit information.
* I gathered information using Wikipedia's "List of rabbit breeds"; link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rabbit_breeds.
